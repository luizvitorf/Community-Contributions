<b>Organization:</b><br/>

I made initial contact with the managers of the Autoglass company so that we could hold the first meeting of the TI-ES community at this location. We aligned several details for the day of the event, date, speakers and topics to be covered, number of participants, etc. We also held some alignment meetings before the event.<br/>
