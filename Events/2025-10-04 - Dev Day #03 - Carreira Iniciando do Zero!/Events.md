<b>Organization:</b><br/>

I made initial contact with the Multivix college officials so that we could hold the first meeting of the TI-ES community there. We aligned several details for the event day: date, speakers and topics to be covered, number of participants, etc. We also held some alignment meetings before the event, and in the first in-person meeting, some members of the organization (including myself) met the officials and introduced the TI-ES community, talked about the events we had already held, etc.<br/>

<b>Event:</b><br/>

In the first lecture, Daniel Brito spoke about "Implementing a data-driven culture in a retail company (Bemol Case Study)".<br/>

In the second lecture, I (Luiz Lima) and Christyan Oliveira spoke about "Career: Starting from Zero!". It was a very cool lecture, where we shared several tips for those starting a career in IT. We also answered several questions from the participants.
